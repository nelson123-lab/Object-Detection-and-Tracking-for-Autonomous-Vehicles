# Object-Detection-and-Tracking-for-Autonomous-Vehicles

- Developed an object detection and tracking system for autonomous vehicles using YOLOv8 Segmentation with DeepSORT Object Tracking, which is a combination of the YOLOv8 object detection model and the DeepSORT object tracking algorithm.
- Trained the YOLOv8 model to accurately detect and classify objects in the environment, such as vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs.
- Used the DeepSORT algorithm to track the detected objects over time and predict their future positions, while also assigning unique IDs to each object and displaying their trails.
- Achieved a high level of accuracy in detecting and tracking objects in a variety of lighting and weather conditions, which can improve the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving.
- Reduced the workload of autonomous vehicle operators by automating the object detection and tracking process, allowing them to focus on other tasks.

There are several machine learning models that can be used for object detection in autonomous vehicles. Some of the commonly used models are:
1. Faster R-CNN: Faster R-CNN is a popular object detection model that uses a region proposal network to generate object proposals and a convolutional neural network to classify and refine the proposals.
2. YOLO (You Only Look Once): YOLO is another popular object detection model that uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images.
3. SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector): SSD is a real-time object detection model that uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images.
4. RetinaNet: RetinaNet is a state-of-the-art object detection model that uses a focal loss function to address the class imbalance problem in object detection.
